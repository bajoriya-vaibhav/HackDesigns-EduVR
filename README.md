## EDU-VR
Project for HackDesigns hackathon

## Installation
1) npm i
2) npm run dev

## Inspiration
Making education more immersive and removing root learning from the equation. Also, make online 2D lectures more class-like with an immersive VR experience
## What it does
It is a website that has implemented VR into its education system. It has many features like a Progress bar, Current courses, etc.
## How we built it
Using react JSX and tailwind CSS we built this project initially we made a basic layout of what we wanted to implement and then we started doing things in parts and combined them in the end
## Challenges we ran into
Combining codes from both creators was difficult as we used different technologies causing layout issues which got fixed in the end
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Being able to make a full-fetched website in much less time can convey our motto
## What we learned
We learned to use tailwind CSS and @mui for components and many things about VR and education in general not only did it help us learn to make better designs but also helped encapsulate our vision
## What's next for EduVR
Adding VR lectures, A student database for keeping everything on track, and more components to fulfill our motto
